  <h1>Competition Model</h1>

  <p>
    The Challenge will take place in two phases. During a two-week
    coding phase, participants can develop their player and compete with the
    work of other participants to see who's doing best. Afterward, a
    double-elimination tournament will decide the winners.
  </p>

  <h2>Participation and Rewards</h2>

  <p>
    The competition is open to all members of the Gunn Competitive Programming Club. You are invited
    to work individually to develop the best player they
    can. The winners will be orzed.
  </p>

  <h2>Duration</h2>

  <p>
    At June 19, 2023, the coding phase of the competition will
    start. Participants will be able to start developing and submitting their
    player code via the Queue site as described below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coding phase will run for two weeks. Participants can develop their
    players, submit preliminary versions of their code and even compete with
    preliminary versions of other players.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of the coding phase, 21:00 PDT on May 3, 2023 (the night of May 3)
    participants must submit the final version of
    their player. The last version submitted before this deadline is
    considered the final submission.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Preliminary Matches
    <h2>
      <p>
        A day of the coding phase runs from 00:00 UTC to 00:00 UTC the next
        day. With the exception of the last day, preliminary matches are held
        after every coding day. At the end of each day, a snapshot of the
        latest version of every participant's player will be taken. Each
        player will compete in 3 matches with randomly selected players from
        other participants. A win/loss record for these random matches will
        be recorded for each participant and reported publicly at a random
        Discord channel (probably).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the three random matches, each day you may request up
        to three additional matches with the latest preliminary version of the
        players from other participants. These matches are held at the same
        time as the random matches and depend on the state of players at the
        end of the coding day. This is called a challenge match. Results of a
        challenge match are not included in the preliminary win/loss record
        and are not publicly available, but a recording of the match is made
        available to both participants in the match. Thus, if you request a
        challenge match, you get to see how your opponent plays, but they also
        get to see how you play.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recordings of challenge matches are available the next day from the
        Discord channel or Direct Messages with the host. Recordings of randomly
        selected matches are not available.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Tournament</h2>

      <p>
        At 21:00 PDT on May 3, 2023, a final snapshot of every player
        will be taken. These are considered the participants' official
        submissions. Over the next few days, a double-elimination tournament
        among these final submissions will be conducted and posted on the
        Discord channel.
