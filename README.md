# CPCSummerBattlecode
Code for my bot for the Gunn Competitive Programming Club Summer Battlecode Challenge


## Ideas
### Minor ideas
* Calculate knockback result when throwing snowballs, so that we know opponent locations even if they're not visible
* Strafe sideways to dodge
* Gang up on a single isolated opponent
* Continue building snowmen throughout game

### Major ideas
* Build a tunneling fort bot
  * Snowmen of height 9 are very difficult to kill because snowballs drop throughout the throw
  * Advancing the children forward on the field will be difficult because they'll be exposed while building
* Implement a Team Building Activity (collaborating on a snowman)
